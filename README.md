At the heart of InMood is a cutting-edge facial expression identification engine that revolutionizes music recommendation. Our team developed this technology to provide users with a truly personalized and unique customized experience that goes beyond traditional recommendation strategies. Our engine is powered by a sophisticated convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm that has been trained on a vast dataset of over 28,000 [facial images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/astraszab/facial-expression-dataset-image-folders-fer2013) with 7 emotion labels.
